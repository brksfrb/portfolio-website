  "shortDescription": "Draw your own digits, train a CNN to recognize them, and test live predictions in real time.",
  "description": "A beginner-friendly deep learning project that lets users draw handwritten digits (0-9), create a dataset, train a custom Convolutional Neural Network (DigitNet) using PyTorch, evaluate model performance with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix, and test the trained model live. Includes tools for data generation and interactive prediction.",
